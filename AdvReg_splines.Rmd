### What are splines and why do we care?
In principle splines are a way of fitting smooth functions to data. 
Smooth functions are ways of estimating a non-linear relationship, which include
splines (lots of different types), kernel smoothers and local
linear smoothers. Splines make more sense, so we will focus on those. 

In principle it includes fitting polinomials
