## What I learned about fitting polinomials
#when do we even need a polinomial?

In week two of the Advanced Regression Module we learned about fitting polinomials, 
which one can do in many ways. 
We started off by looking at how does the data look like. Do we even need a polinomial?



```{r} 
data<-read.csv("data/triceps.csv")

plot(data$triceps~data$age)
```

looks like we do, don't we? 
Let us try to fit a simple linear regression line to the data. 

```{r}
linear<-lm(triceps~age, data=data)


plot(data$triceps~data$age)
abline(linear, col="red")
```

Plotting a simple line to the data reveals that:
*the rise at age=0-5 and 
*the falls at ages=5-12 
are not captured by the line 

```{r}
summary(linear)
```
even though the summary is statistically signficant (pval<0.05***)
